## Sharing üíó

Project is open source. Feel free to make your own version. All you need to do is to fork this repository, edit [src/editable-stuff/config.js](./src/editable-stuff/config.js) and add your resume. Click the star ‚≠ê if you like the project.

## Prerequisites üç™

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your PC. You should also have a GitHub account.

## Setup And Deployment üîß

1. To get started, fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repo from your account using:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/home.git
   ```

3. Open in your favorite editor and edit [src/editable-stuff/config.js](./src/editable-stuff/config.js) file.

4. Add your resume as <resume.pdf> in place of [src/editable-stuff/resume.pdf](./src/editable-stuff/)

5. Edit [title](./public/index.html#L34) and meta [description](./public/index.html#L13) in [public/index.html](./public/index.html).
6. Change URL in [package.json](./package.json) file:

   ```json
    "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/home"
   ```

   Or for deployment at custom domain, refer to [create-react-app.dev](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#step-1-add-homepage-to-packagejson)

7. After editing, run the following bash commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the dependencies needed to run this app. The dependencies will be stored in a folder named node_modules under the home folder.
   
   After installing the dependencies, you can first test the app before deploying it by running:
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start up the app. You can access it from your favorite browser and entering for the URL:
   
   ```
   localhost:3000
   ```

8. To deploy website, first run:

   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```
   This will create a build folder under the home folder that will hold all the final assets that will be deployed. Finally, to deploy, run:
   
   ```bash
    npm run deploy
   ```

   Or for deployment at \<username>.github.io, refer to [READMEdocs/custom-deployment.md](./READMEdocs/custom-deployment.md) and [pages.js](./pages.js)

9. Congrats! Your site is up and running. To see it live, visit:

   ```https
     https://<your-username>.github.io/home
   ```

10. To change the thumbnail image:

    - Navigate to the "public" folder.  
    - There you will see "social-image.png".  
    - Delete it.   
    - Take a screenshot of your version and rename it "social-image.png" and place it there.  
    
   Next time if you make changes, repeat from step 8.
